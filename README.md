### What I learned

I'm new to grids and wanted to do anything with them, so I chose this project and learned some fundamental and interesting grid concepts. I learned how to use grid lines and how crucial it is to use grid tools.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin powell video on grids](https://youtu.be/rg7Fvvl3taU) - This made it easier for me to grasp grid lines and how to use them. This pattern appealed to me and I intend to utilise it in the future.
